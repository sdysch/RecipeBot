Method
1 
 Soak the dried porcini in warm water for 1 hr

 Add the whole onions and a pinch of sea salt, and cook over a low heat until caramelised, about 20 mins, stirring occasionally
 Remove the onions and set aside

 Meanwhile, cut the fresh mushrooms into halves and quarters, to give rough 4cm pieces
 Once the onions have been removed from the pan, add the remaining oil and cook the fresh mushrooms and garlic over a medium heat for 10 mins until browned, stirring frequently
 Return the onions to the pan, pour in the wine and cook for 5-10 mins until reduced by half


3 
 Strain the porcini, reserving 200ml of the soaking liquid
 Tip the porcini and reserved liquid into the pan with the tomato purée, vinegar, bay leaves, allspice, cinnamon, cloves, peppercorns and tomatoes


4 
 Cook, uncovered, over a medium-low heat for about 1 hr, stirring occasionally, until the liquid thickens
 Add the olives and honey, and season to taste
 Sprinkle with the parsley and cheese and serve with Horseradish mash (see 'Goes well with')
