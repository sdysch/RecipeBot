================= french_onion_soup =================
 Serves 4 

Ingredients:
4 large Spanish onions (about 900g/2lb)
3 tbsp extra virgin rapeseed oil
4 thyme sprigs
2 bay leaves
300ml dry white wine
1 rounded tbsp plain flour
1 tbsp Swiss vegetable bouillon
1 garlic clove, crushed
1 tbsp extra virgin rapeseed oil
4 long slices from a baguette
25g parmesan, or vegetarian alternative, coarsely grated
50g gruyère, coarsely grated


Method
1 
 Cut the onions in half lengthways, then slice down into very thin slices
 Heat a very large pan, add the oil when hot, stir in the onions, 3 of the thyme sprigs and the bay leaves, then season with a little salt
 It will seem like a lot of onions, but they reduce right down
 Cook over a high heat for 5 mins, stirring often
 The onions shouldn’t brown yet, just start to soften
 Lower the heat, then cook slowly for 35 mins, uncovered, stirring often until the onions have reduced right down and are very soft


2 
 While the onions are cooking, bring the wine to a boil in a small pan, then bubble away for 30 secs
 Remove and leave to cool
 Tip the flour into a small heavy pan and toast over a medium heat for a few mins, stirring occasionally, until light brown in colour
 Set aside


3 
 When the onions are very soft and reduced, turn up the heat so they caramelise, then cook for another 12-15 mins, stirring along the bottom of the pan occasionally to mix in the brown sticky bits
 When the bottom of the pan and all the onions are sticky and a rich brown colour, stir in the flour
 With the heat still high, gradually pour in the wine, again stirring in the bits from the bottom
 Pour in 1
2 litres of cold water
 Stir in the bouillon, then slowly bring everything to the boil
 Skim off any froth from the surface
 Simmer for 15 mins so all the flavours can mingle


4 
 While the soup simmers, make the topping
 Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6
 Mix the garlic and the oil together
 Brush all over the bread slices, then cut each one into cubes
 Scatter over a baking sheet, then bake for 8-10 mins until golden
 Set aside
 Line a baking sheet with baking parchment or a sheet of non-stick silicone
 Remove the leaves from the remaining thyme sprig, then mix with the grated Parmesan
 Scatter and spread over the lined baking sheet into a 13 x 8cm rectangle
 Bake for about 8 mins until melted and turning golden
 Remove, leave to firm up, then snap into jagged pieces


5 
 To serve, remove and discard the herbs from the soup
 Ladle the soup into bowls – scatter over a few croutons, the gruyère and a grinding of pepper, then perch a parmesan crisp on top
 Serve any remaining croutons separately
