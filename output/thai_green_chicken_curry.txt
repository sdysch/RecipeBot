 Serves 6 

Ingredients:
225g new potatoes, cut into chunks
100g green beans, trimmed and halved
1 tbsp vegetable or sunflower oil
1 garlic clove, chopped
1 rounded tbsp or 4 tsp Thai green curry paste (you can't fit the tablespoon into some of the jars)
400ml can coconut milk
2 tsp Thai fish sauce
1 tsp caster sugar
450g boneless skinless chicken (breasts or thighs), cut into bite-size pieces
2 fresh kaffir lime leaves finely shredded, or 3 wide strips lime zest, plus extra to garnish
good handful of basil leaves
boiled rice, to serve


Method
1 
 Put 225g new potatoes, cut into chunks, in a pan of boiling water and cook for 5 minutes


2 
 Add 100g trimmed and halved green beans and cook for a further 3 minutes, by which time both should be just tender but not too soft
 Drain and put to one side


3 
 In a wok or large frying pan, heat 1 tbsp vegetable or sunflower oil until very hot, then drop in 1 chopped garlic clove and cook until golden, this should take only a few seconds
 Don’t let it go very dark or it will spoil the taste
 

4 
 Spoon in 1 rounded tbsp Thai green curry paste and stir it around for a few seconds to begin to cook the spices and release all the flavours


5 
 Next, pour in a 400ml can of coconut milk and let it come to a bubble


6 
 Stir in 2 tsp Thai fish sauce and 1 tsp caster sugar, then 450g bite-size chicken pieces
 Turn the heat down to a simmer and cook, covered, for about 8 minutes until the chicken is cooked


7 
 Tip in the potatoes and beans and let them warm through in the hot coconut milk, then add 2 finely shredded kaffir lime leaves (or 3 wide strips lime zest)


8 
 Add a good handful basil leaves, but only leave them briefly on the heat or they will quickly lose their brightness
  

9 
 Scatter with lime to garnish and serve immediately with boiled rice
